# IssuePilot User Guide

English | [简体中文](./USAGE.zh-CN.md)

This guide is for **engineers running IssuePilot for the first time**. The
goal: turn a single GitLab Issue into a branch, a Merge Request and an Issue
note automatically, then scale a single shared machine up to multiple GitLab
projects with CI / review feedback and workspace cleanup wired in.

> **Versions covered**: V1 single-project local loop + V2 team-operable
> release (Phase 1–5 merged into main).
> **Maintenance**: top-level bilingual entry; keep in sync with
> [`USAGE.zh-CN.md`](./USAGE.zh-CN.md).

## Part 1 — Overview

### 1.1 What IssuePilot does

IssuePilot is a local-first orchestrator that runs on a single dev machine or
a shared team machine. One complete cycle:

1. Polls GitLab and finds Issues labelled `ai-ready`.
2. Creates an isolated git worktree per Issue under `~/.issuepilot`.
3. Spawns `codex app-server` in that worktree to drive Codex.
4. Pushes the branch, opens or updates a Merge Request, writes a handoff note
   on the Issue.
5. Transitions the Issue label from `ai-running` to `human-review` /
   `ai-failed` / `ai-blocked`.
6. During `human-review`, periodically scans MR pipeline, reviewer comments,
   and prunes expired worktrees per retention policy (V2).
7. When a human merges the MR, IssuePilot writes a closing note, removes
   `human-review` and closes the Issue.

IssuePilot is not a SaaS, not a cluster, and **never auto-merges MRs**.

### 1.2 V1 single-project vs V2 team mode

| Dimension | V1 single-project | V2 team mode |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Best for | Personal machine, one daemon → one project | Shared machine, one daemon → many GitLab projects |
| Entry | `issuepilot run --workflow /path/to/WORKFLOW.md` | `issuepilot run --config /path/to/issuepilot.team.yaml` |
| Config source of truth | Per-project `WORKFLOW.md` | `issuepilot.team.yaml` aggregating multiple `WORKFLOW.md` files |
| Concurrency | Single run, one worktree | 1–5, global + per-project lease prevents duplicate claim |
| Dashboard actions | retry / stop / archive available | retry / stop / archive not yet wired (returns `503 actions_unavailable`) |
| CI feedback | ✅ | ✅ |
| Review feedback sweep | ✅ | ✅ |
| Workspace cleanup loop | ✅ | ⚠ `retention` schema parsed but cleanup loop not yet running (follow-up) |
| Dashboard project view | Single project | All projects listed in team config order |

The two entrypoints are **mutually exclusive**; passing both exits with an
error. They can coexist: in a team scenario where you want Phase 5 cleanup
right now, the fallback is to launch per-project V1 daemons.

### 1.3 Repositories and directory roles

```text
/path/to/issuepilot                       This repo. Build / package only here.
  pnpm release:pack                       Produces ./dist/release/issuepilot-*.tgz

/path/to/target-project                   The business repo Codex modifies; hosts WORKFLOW.md.
  WORKFLOW.md                             Loaded by IssuePilot as both prompt and contract.

~/.issuepilot/                            Local runtime state
  repos/                                  bare git mirror
  workspaces/<project>/<iid>/             one git worktree per Issue
  state/leases-*.json                     V2 lease store
  state/runs/                             run records (JSON)
  state/events/                           JSONL event store (one file per Issue)
  state/logs/issuepilot.log               pino structured log
  credentials                             OAuth tokens (0600)

Installed CLI
  issuepilot doctor                       environment self-check
  issuepilot validate                     validate workflow / team config
  issuepilot run --workflow ...           V1 single-project entry
  issuepilot run --config ...             V2 team-mode entry
  issuepilot dashboard                    launch the read-only dashboard (default :3000)
```

## Part 2 — Quick walkthrough (~30 minutes)

Shortest path from "installed nothing" to "first Issue in `human-review`".

### 2.1 Environment requirements

| Tool | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Node.js | `>=22 <23` |
| pnpm | `10.x` (via corepack) |
| Git | `>=2.40` |
| Codex CLI | Can run `codex app-server` and is signed in |
| GitLab | A test project with API / label / Issue / MR support |
| SSH key | Can push to the target project |

### 2.2 Install IssuePilot

Inside the **IssuePilot repo**:

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install
pnpm release:pack
npm install -g ./dist/release/issuepilot-0.1.0.tgz
issuepilot doctor
```

Expected: `doctor` reports `[OK]` for Node.js, Git, Codex app-server, and
`~/.issuepilot/state`.

> **Contributor fallback** (run from the source tree without global install):
> ```bash
> pnpm build
> pnpm exec issuepilot doctor
> pnpm exec issuepilot validate --workflow /path/to/target-project/WORKFLOW.md
> ```

### 2.3 First-run checklist

```text
[ ] Part 3.1   6 workflow labels exist in the target GitLab project
[ ] Part 3.2   ssh -T succeeds against the GitLab host
[ ] Part 3.3   target-project root contains WORKFLOW.md (committed)
[ ] Part 3.4   OAuth logged in OR token environment variable exported
[ ] Part 3.5   issuepilot validate --workflow prints "Validation passed."
[ ] Part 4.1   Terminal A: issuepilot run --workflow ...; Terminal B: issuepilot dashboard
[ ] Part 4.2   Create a tiny Issue in GitLab and label it ai-ready
[ ] Part 4.2   In ~10s a run appears on dashboard; minutes later label flips to human-review
```

---

## Part 3 — Prepare the target GitLab project

These steps are all performed in the **target project** (the business repo
Codex modifies). One-time setup, then reusable by both V1 and V2.

### 3.1 Create workflow labels

| Label | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `ai-ready` | Candidate Issue; IssuePilot will claim it |
| `ai-running` | IssuePilot has claimed it, in progress |
| `human-review` | MR ready; awaiting human review |
| `ai-rework` | Human asked AI to take another pass |
| `ai-failed` | Run failed; needs human investigation |
| `ai-blocked` | Missing info / permission / secret |

### 3.2 SSH can push to the target project

`workflow.git.repo_url` should use SSH. IssuePilot's Git push uses your local
SSH key, not the GitLab API token.

```bash
ssh -T git@gitlab.example.com
# If your org has two GitLab instances, test both:
ssh -T git@gitlab.chehejia.com
ssh -T git@gitlabee.chehejia.com
```

### 3.3 Author `WORKFLOW.md`

Create `WORKFLOW.md` at the **root of the target project** and commit it to
the default branch.

```bash
cd /path/to/target-project
$EDITOR WORKFLOW.md
```

Minimum template:

```md
---
tracker:
  kind: gitlab
  base_url: "https://gitlab.example.com"
  project_id: "group/project"
  active_labels:
    - ai-ready
    - ai-rework
  running_label: ai-running
  handoff_label: human-review
  failed_label: ai-failed
  blocked_label: ai-blocked
  rework_label: ai-rework

workspace:

  base_branch: main
  branch_prefix: ai

agent:

You are the AI engineer for this repository.

Issue: {{ issue.identifier }}
Title: {{ issue.title }}
URL: {{ issue.url }}

Description:
{{ issue.description }}

Requirements:

1. Read relevant code before editing.
2. Work only inside the provided workspace.
3. Implement the Issue description.
4. Commit changes and use `gitlab_create_merge_request` to open / update the MR.
5. Use `gitlab_create_issue_note` to post implementation, validation, risk and MR link back to the Issue.
6. Let the orchestrator transition the Issue to `human-review` on success.
7. If you lack info / permission / secret, call `gitlab_transition_labels` to set `ai-blocked` with reason.
```

Commit:

```bash
git add WORKFLOW.md
git commit -m "chore(issuepilot): add workflow"
git push origin main
```

Field cheat sheet:

| Field | How to fill |
| --- | --- |
| `tracker.kind` | always `gitlab`; do not write `gitlabee` |
| `tracker.base_url` | GitLab instance URL |
| `tracker.project_id` | project path or numeric ID |
| `tracker.token_env` | **only when using the env-token path**; value is a variable name, not a token value |
| `git.repo_url` | SSH clone URL of the target project |
| `git.base_branch` | MR target branch (usually `main`) |
| `agent.max_concurrent_agents` | start with `1`, ramp up only after it is stable |
| `codex.approval_policy` | P0 recommends `never` |
| `poll_interval_ms` | default 10000ms; smaller = faster reaction, more GitLab API load |

⚠ Workflow rejects `danger-full-access` / `dangerFullAccess` sandbox; never
write a plaintext token — everything is injected through env vars or OAuth
credentials.

### 3.4 Configure GitLab credentials

Pick one. Personal dev machines should use **OAuth**; CI or shared
environments should use **env-token**.

#### Path A: OAuth (recommended)

Prerequisite: an OAuth Application registered in each GitLab instance by an
admin.

- Entry: `https://<gitlab-host>/admin/applications`
- Name: `IssuePilot`
- Confidential: **unchecked** (must be a public application)
- Scopes: `api`, `read_repository`, `write_repository`
- Enable Device Authorization Grant if your GitLab exposes the toggle
- Save and copy the **Application ID**; this becomes `--client-id` below

```bash
issuepilot auth login --hostname gitlab.example.com --client-id <oauth-application-id>
issuepilot auth status --hostname gitlab.example.com
```

After login the token lands in `~/.issuepilot/credentials` (`0600`). The
daemon auto-refreshes and retries once on 401. **When using OAuth, do not
set `tracker.token_env` in the workflow** — setting it makes IssuePilot
require that env var.

Multiple GitLab instances:

```bash
issuepilot auth login --hostname gitlab.chehejia.com --client-id <oauth-application-id>
issuepilot auth login --hostname gitlabee.chehejia.com --client-id <oauth-application-id>
```

#### Path B: Env-token

If you already have a PAT / Group Access Token / Project Access Token, the
workflow's `tracker` block **must** include `token_env`:

```yaml
tracker:
  base_url: "https://gitlab.chehejia.com"
  token_env: "GITLAB_TOKEN"

tracker:
  base_url: "https://gitlabee.chehejia.com"
  token_env: "GITLABEE_TOKEN"
```

Before starting the daemon:

```bash
export GITLAB_TOKEN="<gitlab.chehejia.com token>"
export GITLABEE_TOKEN="<gitlabee.chehejia.com token>"
```

Tokens must never appear in `WORKFLOW.md`, Issues, prompts or logs.

### 3.5 Validate the config

Validate without starting the daemon and without hitting GitLab:

```bash
export WORKFLOW_PATH="/path/to/target-project/WORKFLOW.md"
issuepilot validate --workflow "$WORKFLOW_PATH"
```

Expected:

```text
Workflow loaded: /path/to/target-project/WORKFLOW.md
GitLab project: group/project
Validation passed.
```

Common failures:

| Error | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `WorkflowConfigError: tracker` | Check workflow front matter field names and indentation |
| `WorkflowConfigError: tracker.token_env` | Workflow declares `token_env` but the env var is missing; either export it or drop `token_env` and use OAuth |
| `GitLabError(category="auth")` | Token wrong, expired, or OAuth credentials missing |
| `GitLabError(category="permission")` | Token lacks `api` scope or has no access to the project |

---

## Part 4 — V1 single-project mode: personal dev machine

### 4.1 Start orchestrator + dashboard

Two terminals.

**Terminal A — orchestrator:**

```bash
export WORKFLOW_PATH="/path/to/target-project/WORKFLOW.md"
issuepilot run --workflow "$WORKFLOW_PATH" --port 4738 --host 127.0.0.1
```

Once ready, the log prints `API: http://127.0.0.1:4738`.

> Contributor fallback from source: `pnpm exec issuepilot run --workflow "$WORKFLOW_PATH"`.

**Terminal B — dashboard:**

```bash
issuepilot dashboard
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`. By default the dashboard talks to
`http://127.0.0.1:4738`. If the orchestrator uses another port:

```bash
issuepilot dashboard --api-url http://127.0.0.1:4839
```

If you see `IssuePilot orchestrator unreachable` / `fetch failed`, confirm
the orchestrator is still running in Terminal A and that the dashboard is
pointed at the same port.

The home page is the **V2.5 Command Center** — a single screen with a
**List view** and a **Board view** (toggle in the top-right). Click a run to
open the inline Review Packet inspector; click the run ID to open the full
run detail page, which now starts with a **Review Packet** section that
mirrors the structured handoff, validation, risks, follow-ups, and
merge-readiness verdict from the run's persisted report. The Reports
aggregator lives at `http://127.0.0.1:3000/reports` and summarises
ready-to-merge, blocked, and failed counters from local report artifacts.

The dashboard is bilingual: use the **EN / 中** toggle in the sidebar to
switch between English and 简体中文. The choice is stored in the
`issuepilot-locale` cookie and applies to every page (Command Center,
Reports, run detail). Technical tokens — status labels (`running`,
`completed`, `failed`, `blocked`, `human-review`, `ai-ready`, …),
readiness verdicts (`ready` / `not-ready` / `blocked` / `unknown`), CI
status, run ids, branches, paths, and product names like `IssuePilot` /
`Codex` / `GitLab` / `MR` / `Workflow` / `Workspace` — remain English in
both locales by design.

> Merge readiness is a **dry-run only** evaluator: it tells you whether
> CI, approvals, review feedback, and risks look ready. IssuePilot will not
> call any GitLab merge API — humans still own the actual merge decision.

### 4.2 Run the first Issue

In the target GitLab project:

1. Create a tiny Issue (e.g. "Append `Hello from IssuePilot` to README").
2. Apply the `ai-ready` label. **No need** to assign it to yourself.

Within ~10 seconds IssuePilot should:

```text
1. Flip Issue label ai-ready → ai-running
2. A run appears in dashboard with status running
3. ~/.issuepilot/workspaces/<project>/<iid> contains the worktree
4. Codex edits files in the worktree and commits
5. Push the ai/<iid>-<slug> branch
6. Open a draft MR
7. Post a handoff note on the Issue: ## IssuePilot handoff ...
8. Flip the Issue label to human-review
```

Then a human reviews the MR:

- **Merge the MR** → IssuePilot auto-writes a closing note, removes
  `human-review`, closes the Issue.
- **Ask AI for another pass** → set the label to `ai-rework` (Phase 4 review
  feedback sweep structures your MR comments into the next prompt).
- **Close the MR without merging** → IssuePilot reverts the label to
  `ai-rework`.

### 4.3 What to do for each of the 6 label states

| Current label | What you should do |
| --- | --- |
| `ai-ready` | Wait for IssuePilot to pick it up (every `poll_interval_ms`) |
| `ai-running` | Watch the dashboard; do not change labels manually |
| `human-review` | Review the MR in GitLab; optionally wait for CI auto-update |
| `ai-rework` | Wait for IssuePilot to take another pass |
| `ai-failed` | Inspect dashboard timeline + failure note; fix and click Retry, or relabel to `ai-ready` |
| `ai-blocked` | Provide missing info / permission / secret, then relabel to `ai-ready` |

---

## Part 5 — V2 team mode: shared machine + multiple projects

V2 keeps V1 intact and adds a `--config` team entrypoint plus four sets of
capabilities: dashboard actions, CI failure flip-back, review feedback sweep,
and workspace retention.

### 5.1 Entrypoint comparison

| Usage | When to use | Command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| V1 single-project | Personal machine; one daemon → one project | `issuepilot run --workflow /path/to/WORKFLOW.md` |
| V2 team mode | Shared machine; one daemon → many projects; lease prevents duplicate claim | `issuepilot run --config /path/to/issuepilot.team.yaml` |

They are **mutually exclusive**; passing both exits with an error.

### 5.2 Minimal team config

V2 team mode keeps `WORKFLOW.md` out of the business repo: an
`issuepilot-config/` directory owns one `issuepilot.team.yaml`, a small
project file per project, and a shared workflow profile reused across
projects. `WORKFLOW.md` in a business repo is no longer a supported
team-mode input.

```text
issuepilot-config/
  issuepilot.team.yaml
  projects/
    platform-web.yaml
    infra-tools.yaml
  workflows/
    default-web.md
    default-node-lib.md
```

`issuepilot-config/issuepilot.team.yaml`:

```yaml
version: 1

server:
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 4738

scheduler:
  max_concurrent_runs: 2
  max_concurrent_runs_per_project: 1
  lease_ttl_ms: 900000
  poll_interval_ms: 10000

defaults:
  labels: ./policies/labels.gitlab.yaml
  codex: ./policies/codex.default.yaml
  workspace_root: ~/.issuepilot/workspaces
  repo_cache_root: ~/.issuepilot/repos

projects:
  - id: platform-web
    name: Platform Web
    project: ./projects/platform-web.yaml
    workflow_profile: ./workflows/default-web.md
    enabled: true
  - id: infra-tools
    name: Infra Tools
    project: ./projects/infra-tools.yaml
    workflow_profile: ./workflows/default-node-lib.md
    enabled: true

# Optional: team-level CI defaults; projects[].ci can override (all 3 keys required together)
ci:
  enabled: true
  on_failure: ai-rework        # or human-review
  wait_for_pipeline: true

# Optional: team-level workspace retention defaults
retention:
  successful_run_days: 7
  failed_run_days: 30
  max_workspace_gb: 50
  cleanup_interval_ms: 3600000
```

`projects/platform-web.yaml` — only project facts (no token, no runner):

```yaml
tracker:
  kind: gitlab
  base_url: https://gitlab.example.com
  project_id: group/platform-web

git:
  repo_url: git@gitlab.example.com:group/platform-web.git
  base_branch: main
  branch_prefix: ai

agent:
  max_turns: 10
  max_attempts: 2
```

`workflows/default-web.md` — prompt + runtime guardrails shared across
projects of the same shape:

```md
---
agent:
  runner: codex-app-server
  max_concurrent_agents: 1

codex:
  approval_policy: never
  thread_sandbox: workspace-write

ci:
  enabled: true
  on_failure: ai-rework
  wait_for_pipeline: true
---

You are working on GitLab project `{{ project.tracker.project_id }}`.
Target repo: `{{ project.git.repo_url }}`, default branch `{{ project.git.base_branch }}`.
```

Field constraints (violations fail at startup with a dotted path):

| Field | Constraint |
| --- | --- |
| `version` | must be `1` |
| `scheduler.max_concurrent_runs` | `1..5` |
| `scheduler.lease_ttl_ms` | `>= 60000` |
| `scheduler.poll_interval_ms` | `>= 1000` |
| `projects[].id` | lowercase alphanum + dashes; unique per config |
| `projects[].project` | required; relative paths resolve against the team config directory |
| `projects[].workflow_profile` | required; relative paths resolve against the team config directory |
| `ci` (precedence) | `projects[].ci > team ci > workflow profile ci`; any override must set all three keys |

`projects[].workflow` (the legacy single-file pointer) is **no longer
supported in team mode**; the loader rejects it with a dotted-path
error.

Compiled `WorkflowConfig` for each project is internal; use
`issuepilot render-workflow --config ... --project ...` to inspect the
effective workflow without persisting it on disk.

### 5.3 Validate and launch

```bash
# Validate before launch (no GitLab, no daemon)
issuepilot validate --config /path/to/issuepilot.team.yaml

# Launch the team daemon
issuepilot run --config /path/to/issuepilot.team.yaml
```

`validate --config` and daemon startup share one `loadTeamConfig` pipeline,
so YAML errors and zod schema errors both surface with the dotted path.

Dashboard works the same as V1:

```bash
issuepilot dashboard --api-url http://127.0.0.1:4738
```

In V2 the dashboard's `Projects` strip lists every project in team config
order; `enabled: false` shows a neutral `disabled` badge; a project whose
workflow fails to load shows a red `load error` badge with the error summary.

### 5.4 Phase 2 — Dashboard actions (retry / stop / archive)

Dashboard runs list and detail pages expose three buttons. Every action
emits an `operator_action_*` event to the event store.

| Action | Applies to | Behavior | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Retry** | `ai-failed` / `ai-blocked` / `ai-rework` / archived failed run | Issue label flips to `ai-rework`; run status set to `claimed` | V2 team daemon not wired yet → `503 actions_unavailable`; V1 works |
| **Stop** | Active `ai-running` run | Real Codex `turn/interrupt`; 5s timeout escalates `stopping` and finally converges via `turnTimeoutMs` | Does not touch GitLab labels directly; failures emit `operator_action_failed { code: cancel_timeout / cancel_threw / not_registered }` |
| **Archive** | Terminal run (`completed` / `failed` / `blocked`) | Records `archivedAt`; dashboard hides by default | List header has a `Show archived` toggle |

Operator identity defaults to the server-side `"system"` fallback; the
`x-issuepilot-operator` HTTP header is the hook for V3 RBAC.

### 5.5 Phase 3 — CI status auto-flip

Enable `ci.enabled` in either `WORKFLOW.md` or team config and, while the
Issue sits in `human-review`, the orchestrator polls the MR pipeline every
`poll_interval_ms`:

```yaml
ci:
  enabled: true
  on_failure: ai-rework        # or human-review
  wait_for_pipeline: true
```

Behavior matrix:

| pipeline state | `on_failure` | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `success` | — | Stay in `human-review`; dashboard marks it ready for review |
| `failed` | `ai-rework` | Label flips to `ai-rework`; note posted with `<!-- issuepilot:ci-feedback:<runId> -->` marker |
| `failed` | `human-review` | Labels untouched; marker note only; `ci_status_observed { action: "noop" }` |
| `running` / `pending` / `unknown` | — | Stay in `human-review`; wait for next poll; no note |
| `canceled` / `skipped` | — | Marker note hinting human review; `ci_status_observed { action: "manual" }` |

Constraints:

- The scanner is wired into the loop at daemon startup based on `ci.enabled`.
  **Changing `ci.enabled` requires restarting `issuepilot run`** to take effect.
- Auto-merge is out of scope for V2.

### 5.6 Phase 4 — Review feedback sweep

Each poll inside `human-review`, the orchestrator scans the MR's human
comments (system notes and IssuePilot's own marker notes are skipped),
structures them into a `ReviewFeedbackSummary`, and persists it on the run
record.

- Dashboard run detail page adds a `Latest review feedback` panel: MR link,
  last sweep time, per-comment author / time / resolved badge / truncated
  body, and deep links to the original MR note.
- When a human flips the Issue back to `ai-rework`, the next dispatch
  prepends a standardised `## Review feedback` markdown block to the prompt;
  reviewer bodies are wrapped in `<<<REVIEWER_BODY id=N>>> ...
  <<<END_REVIEWER_BODY>>>` envelopes to defend against prompt injection.
- **Always on**. No-op when there is no MR or no comment; no workflow toggle.
- Does not auto-merge and does not replace Phase 3 CI feedback.

### 5.7 Phase 5 — Workspace retention

Default retention policy (override in workflow or team config top-level
`retention`):

| Run state | Default kept |
| --- | --- |
| active / running / stopping / claimed / retrying | never auto-deleted |
| successful / closed | 7 days |
| failed / blocked | 30 days |
| archived terminal | counted from original terminal time |

Constraints:

- When total workspace exceeds `max_workspace_gb` (default 50), planner
  **only** removes already-expired terminal runs; capacity pressure never
  justifies removing active or unexpired failures.
- Failed worktrees keep their `.issuepilot/failed-at-*` marker; markers are
  not pruned by default.
- Cleanup emits a three-step event sequence: `workspace_cleanup_planned`
  → `workspace_cleanup_completed` / `workspace_cleanup_failed`, written
  under the sentinel `runId=workspace-cleanup`. Read via
  `/api/events?runId=workspace-cleanup` or the dashboard timeline.
- **Limitation: the V2 team daemon currently only parses the `retention`
  schema and does not run the cleanup loop.** Until that is wired, the
  workaround for teams is to launch per-project V1 daemons. This is listed
  as a Phase 5 follow-up.

**Dry-run preview** (no daemon required):

```bash
issuepilot doctor --workspace --workflow /path/to/target-project/WORKFLOW.md
```

Example output (without a daemon, run state is unreadable, so every entry
defaults to `unknown` and the planner refuses to delete; for a real preview
tail the `workspace_cleanup_planned` events):

```text
Workspace cleanup dry-run
  workspace root: ~/.issuepilot/workspaces
  entries: 14
  total usage: 2.471 GB (cap 50 GB)
  will delete: 0
  keep failure markers: 3
```

**Operator runbook** (accidental deletion, cleanup-failure diagnostics,
temporary disable):
[`docs/superpowers/runbooks/2026-05-15-workspace-cleanup.md`](./docs/superpowers/runbooks/2026-05-15-workspace-cleanup.md).

### 5.8 Current V2 boundaries and gaps

The main V2 surface is complete. **Explicitly out of scope** for V2 (will be
handled in V3 / V4):

- Multi-user RBAC; token / budget / quota management.
- Remote workers, Docker / K8s sandboxes.
- Auto-merge, cross-issue dependency planning, auto-decomposition.
- Postgres / SQLite as a hard dependency for long-term run history.
- Multi-tracker plugin model; non-GitLab Issue trackers.
- Remote `ai/*` branch cleanup and MR auto-archival.

Open follow-ups (do not block day-to-day use):

- Wire workspace cleanup loop into the V2 team daemon.
- Wire operator actions into the V2 team daemon (dashboard retry / stop /
  archive currently return `503 actions_unavailable`).

## Part 6 — Day-2 operations and troubleshooting

### 6.1 Where to look

| What you want | Where to look |
| --- | --- |
| Current daemon state / concurrency / poll interval | dashboard service header or `GET /api/state` |
| All runs / status distribution | dashboard `/` (archived hidden by default) |
| Per-run timeline / tool calls / log tail / review feedback | dashboard `/runs/<runId>` |
| Real-time event stream | `GET /api/events/stream?runId=<runId>` (SSE) |
| One Issue's event history | `~/.issuepilot/state/events/<project-slug>-<iid>.jsonl` |
| Per-run metadata | `~/.issuepilot/state/runs/<project-slug>-<iid>.json` |
| Daemon global log | `~/.issuepilot/state/logs/issuepilot.log` |
| Workspace cleanup history | `/api/events?runId=workspace-cleanup` |

### 6.2 Forensics for failed / blocked runs

Failed / blocked runs are not cleaned up automatically. Investigate via:

```bash
~/.issuepilot/state/logs/issuepilot.log
~/.issuepilot/state/events/<project-slug>-<iid>.jsonl
~/.issuepilot/state/runs/<project-slug>-<iid>.json
~/.issuepilot/workspaces/<project-slug>/<iid>/
~/.issuepilot/workspaces/<project-slug>/<iid>/.issuepilot/failed-at-<iso>
```

`.issuepilot/failed-at-*` is dispatcher-written failure context (cause
category, retry decision, error chain). After fixing the root cause, click
`Retry` in the dashboard or manually relabel the Issue back to `ai-ready`
/ `ai-rework`.

### 6.3 FAQ

**`codex app-server not found`**

```bash
which codex
codex app-server --help
```

If Codex is not on PATH, set `codex.command` in the workflow to an absolute
path.

**`auth login failed ... category=invalid_client`**

The GitLab instance has no matching OAuth Application, or Device
Authorization Grant is disabled. Re-register the Application per
[§3.4](#34-configure-gitlab-credentials) and retry:

```bash
issuepilot auth login --hostname <host> --client-id <oauth-application-id>
```

**GitLab 401 / 403**

Confirm the token is exported in the same shell that starts the daemon, has
`api` scope, and can access the project. Fix and restart the orchestrator.

**Dashboard shows `orchestrator unreachable`**

The dashboard is only the frontend; you must run the orchestrator in
another terminal. If the orchestrator is not on `4738`, use
`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` or `--api-url` to point at it.

**Which run produced an Issue note?**

The first line of every IssuePilot note carries the marker
`<!-- issuepilot:run:<runId> -->`. The final handoff note starts with
`## IssuePilot handoff` and contains branch, MR, implementation summary,
validation results, risks / follow-ups, and next steps for the human
reviewer.

**Changed `ci.enabled` and nothing happened**

The scanner is wired into the loop at daemon startup based on `ci.enabled`.
Restart `issuepilot run`.

**V2 team-mode dashboard buttons return 503**

The V2 team daemon does not yet wire operator actions; retry / stop /
archive return `503 actions_unavailable`
([§5.8](#58-current-v2-boundaries-and-gaps) follow-up). Temporary
workaround: launch that project via V1 entry.

**V2 team-mode disk keeps growing**

The V2 team daemon does not yet run the workspace cleanup loop
([§5.7](#57-phase-5--workspace-retention) limitation). Run cleanup
manually:

```bash
issuepilot doctor --workspace --workflow /path/to/target-project/WORKFLOW.md
```

Or switch that project to V1 entry (V1 has the cleanup loop wired).
